Iterative Order Processing in the Restaurant System
What is Iterative Processing?

Iterative processing, in our restaurant system, involves repeatedly executing a set of instructions for each item within a collection. This allows us to handle multiple orders efficiently by processing them in batches, rather than individually. It's akin to having a checklist and systematically going through each item on that list, one by one, until the list is complete.

Steps of the Iterative Order Processing:

Order Batch Collection:

Orders are collected over a specified time interval (e.g., 5 minutes) and stored in a list or queue within the system. This forms the batch of orders to be processed.
Initiating the Iterative Loop:

Once the time interval ends, the system starts the batch processing, beginning the iterative loop that will handle each order.
Processing Each Order (The Iteration):

Step 3.1: Order Selection:
The system selects the first order from the batch.
Step 3.2: Order Preparation:
The system extracts the order details, including items, quantities, and special instructions. It then formats this information into a kitchen-friendly format, such as a digital ticket.
Step 3.3: Order Status Update:
The system marks the order as "Processing" in its database, indicating it is now being prepared.
Step 3.4: Order Sending:
The formatted order is sent to the kitchen display or printer, notifying the kitchen staff of the order.
Step 3.5: Order Logging:
A record is made, noting the order details and the time it was processed, for tracking and analysis.
Loop Repetition:

Steps 3.1 to 3.5 are repeated for each remaining order in the batch. The system moves to the next order and performs the same processing steps.
Batch Completion and Reset:

Once all orders in the batch have been processed, the system may display a summary (e.g., "Processed 15 orders"). The batch is then cleared, ready to collect new orders for the next time interval.
